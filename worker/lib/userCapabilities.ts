// Restricted accounts — what a team-invite-registered user may do.
//
// An account minted through a team invite link carries `origin_team_id`.
// That single column drives three separate constraints:
//
//   1. Capabilities — every resource-creating feature is denied unless the
//      site admin has granted it. Default-deny means a feature added next
//      year is automatically off for these accounts without anyone
//      remembering to gate it.
//   2. Scope — app authorization and team membership are confined to the
//      origin team's subtree (see teamScopeGuard below).
//   3. Lifecycle — a dissolution of the origin team deletes these accounts.
//
// Converting (`converted_at`) lifts all three at once while keeping
// `origin_team_id` for traceability. Everything here therefore has to test
// *restricted and not converted*, never `origin_team_id` alone — a converted
// account is an ordinary account that merely remembers where it came from.
//
// Every check funnels through this module on purpose. The two pre-existing
// feature switches (`disable_user_create_team`, `disable_user_create_app`)
// are already spread over three call sites; layering per-account rules on
// top of that pattern would guarantee a missed spot.
